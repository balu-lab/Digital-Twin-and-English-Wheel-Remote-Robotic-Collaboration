# Digital-Twin-and-English-Wheel-Remote-Robotic-Collaboration
Objectives:
1. Developing computational algorithm to interact and analysis English Wheel manoeuvring with a robotic arm in Mixed reality environment. 
2. Measure the Multimodality performance of the HCI for remote immersive collaboration.

Goals:
1. Literature review on HCI, Digital Twin and Cyber-Human interaction. ( Kevin please share the updated file to Issa). 
2. Develop the GH script to control the digital twin model of the robotic arm. 
3. Develop the GH script to visualise the geometrical deformation data of the metal sheets in the virtual space. 
4. Develop the MR interface with Hololens/Meta through Fologram to do remote collaboration and interaction with the virtual artefact of the robotic arm and English wheel. 
5. Present the framework as a pipeline for digital twin model for English Wheel automation. 
6. Evaluate the system architecture through using the technique of collective intelligence to measure the interaction performance.
